# Comprehensive Investment Analysis Dashboard

An interactive Microsoft Excel-based Investment Analytics Dashboard designed to analyze investment behavior, participant demographics, financial expectations, and correlations between investment variables.

The dashboard enables data-driven decision making through dynamic pivot tables, slicers, and advanced Excel visualizations.

## Project Overview

The dashboard was developed using structured tasks including gender analysis, investment preference evaluation, objective/source analysis, duration/expectation trends, and correlation modeling. 

## Business Objective

1. Understand investor demographics

2. Identify popular investment avenues

3. Analyze investment duration trends

4. Measure expected return behavior

5. Identify correlation between age, duration, and returns

6. Enable stakeholders to explore insights interactively
